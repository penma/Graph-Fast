=head1 NAME

Graph::Fast - graph data structures and algorithms, just faster.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # todo

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Graph::Fast implements a mathematical abstract data structure, called graph,
that models relations between objects with vertices and edges.

=head2 Graph::Fast vs Graph

While L<Graph> is a module with a lot of features, it is not really fast.
Graph::Fast doesn't implement all the features, but it is much faster.
Graph::Fast is for you if you need the most important things done very
fast.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

Available functions are:

=head2 B<new>(I<optional options...>)

Constructs a new Graph::Fast object.

The constructor takes optional parameters as a hash. Currently there are
no options.

=head2 B<count_edges>()

Returns the number of edges in the graph.

=head2 B<count_vertices>()

Returns the number of vertices in the graph.

=head2 B<add_vertex>(I<$name>)

Adds a vertex with the specified name to the graph. Names must be unique.
It is safe to call this with a name that already exists in the graph.

=head2 B<add_edge>(I<$from> => I<$to>, I<$weight>, I<$user_data>)

Adds a directed edge to the graph, pointing from vertex named I<$from> to
I<$to>. The edge has a weight of I<$weight>. Application-specific data
can be added to the edge.

=head2 B<del_edge>(I<$from> => I<$to>)

Removes an edge that points from named vertex I<$from> to I<$to> from the
graph.

It is safe to call this for edges that do not exist.

=head2 B<dijkstra>(I<$from> => I<$to>)

Invokes Dijkstra's algorithm on the graph to find the shortest path from
source vertex I<$from> to destination vertex I<$to>.

If a path is found, it is returned as a list of edges. The edges are
hashrefs with I<from>, I<to>, I<weight> and possibly I<user_data> keys.
If no path is found, an empty list is returned.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

Many features are missing. This includes basic features.

Vertices currently cannot be deleted once added to the graph.

It is unclear how to deal with multiedges (two different edges that connect
the same pair of vertices). The behaviour will likely change in the future.
Currently edges can and will exist only once.

=head1 BUGS

Maybe.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Graph> - slower, but a lot more features

L<Boost::Graph> - faster, written in C++
